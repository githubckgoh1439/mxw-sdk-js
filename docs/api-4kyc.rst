KYC
***

Know Your Customer (KYC) is **required** in Maxonrow blockchain. All wallet,m tokens and administrative
operations(transaction) are require to undergo a KYC process which will verify by three parties (provider, issuer and middleware) beforehand.
Only authorized wallets, tokens and administrative operations(transaction) are allow to process in the blockchain.  

*Administrative operations(transaction) must first signed by provider, then issuer and last by middleware*

Creating Instances
##################

:sup:`Kyc` . create ( signerOrProvider ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<Kyc>`
    Creates a new instance reference from *signerOrProvider* and optionally connect a provider.

.. code-block:: javascript
    :caption: *create an instance of kyc with the reference from provider*

    let provider = mxw.getDefaultProvider("testnet");
    let kyc = Kyc.create(provider);

Signing
#######

:sup:`prototype` . getKycAddress ( keyComponent ) |nbsp| `=> string`
    Compute kyc address from key components by SHA2-256 cryptographic hash and
    convert into bech32 format.

    The valid key components are:

        - **country** --- the country code for issuer
        - **idType** --- the identity document type
        - **id** --- the identity number for the applicant
        - **idExpiry** --- the identity document expiry date (YYYMMDD) in number
        - **dob** --- the applicant date of birth (YYYMMDD) in number
        - **seed** --- additional value to stir into the hashing

    If the *seed* is not specified, it should be default to 32 bytes of zero.

:sup:`prototype` . sign ( keyComponentOrAddress ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<KycData>`
    Signs *KycAddress* and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to
    the signed :ref:`KYC Data <kyc-data>`. The JSON object should be **sorted** and
    signed by applicant's wallet.

        //create a new wallet to
        let networkProvider = mxw.getDefaultProvider("testnet");
        var wallet = mxw.Wallet.createRandom().connect(networkProvider);
        Kyc.create(wallet).then((kycR)=>{
            let seed = sha256(toUtf8Bytes(JSON.stringify(sortObject({
                juridical: ["", ""].sort(),
                seed: utils.getHash(utils.randomBytes(32))
            }))));

            let kycAddress = kycR.getKycAddress({
                country: "MY",
                idType: "NIC",
                id: wallet.address,
                idExpiry: 20200101,
                dob: 19800101,
                seed
            });
            
            console.log("KYC Address: " + kycAddress);
            //expected result: 
            //kyc1ekv4s2e75vyzmjjnve3md9ek5zm3pt66949vclrttgkfrrc6squqlxlpsp

            return kycR.sign(kycAddress).then((data) => {
                console.log(JSON.stringify(data));
            });
            //expected result:
            //Click and the link above on KYC Data

    });
    
:sup:`prototype` . signTransaction ( transaction ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<KycTransaction>`
    Signs *transaction* and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to
    the :ref:`signed transaction <kyc-transaction>`. The transaction should be signed by
    KYC provider or KYC issuer.

:sup:`prototype` . approve ( transaction ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Send the *signedTransaction* to the **entire** blockchain network and returns a
    :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to the :ref:`Transaction Receipt <transaction-receipt>`.
    The transaction should be signed by KYC middleware.

    If an error occurs after the network **may have** received the transaction, the
    promise will reject with the error, with the additional property ``transactionHash``
    so that further processing may be done.

:sup:`prototype` . revoke ( address, signer ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<KycStatusTransaction>`
    Signs *transaction* and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to
    the :ref:`signed transaction <kyc-status-transaction>`. The transaction should be
    signed by KYC provider.

:sup:`prototype` . signStatusTransaction ( transaction, signer ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<KycStatusTransaction>`
    Signs *transaction* and returns a :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to
    the :ref:`signed transaction <kyc-status-transaction>`. The transaction should be
    signed by KYC provider or KYC issuer.

:sup:`prototype` . sendStatusTransaction ( transaction, signer ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Send the *signedTransaction* to the **entire** blockchain network and returns a
    :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to the :ref:`Transaction Receipt <transaction-receipt>`.
    The transaction should be signed by KYC middleware.

    If an error occurs after the network **may have** received the transaction, the
    promise will reject with the error, with the additional property ``transactionHash``
    so that further processing may be done.

:sup:`prototype` . bind ( :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>`, kycAddress, signer ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Create relationship between wallets by sending *kycBind* transaction to the **entire** blockchain network and returns a
    :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to the :ref:`Transaction Receipt <transaction-receipt>`.
    The transaction should be signed by KYC middleware.

    The :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>` can be set to target alias or wallet address. The ``kycAddress`` is the reference of relationship.

:sup:`prototype` . unbind ( :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>`, kycAddress, signer ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<TransactionReceipt>`
    Remove relationship between wallets by sending *kycUnbind* transaction to the **entire** blockchain network and returns a
    :ref:`Promise <promise>` that resolves to the :ref:`Transaction Receipt <transaction-receipt>`.
    The transaction should be signed by KYC middleware.

    The :ref:`AddressOrName <addressOrName>` can be set to target alias or wallet address. The ``kycAddress`` is the reference of relationship.

Checking status
###############

:sup:`wallet` . isWhitelisted ( ) |nbsp| `=> Promise<Boolean>`
    Return a :ref:`Promise <promise>` of the wallet white list status.
    Query KYC whitelist status by wallet address.

.. code-block:: javascript
    :caption: check if the wallet is white listed

    let privateKey = "0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef";
    let networkProvider = mxw.getDefaultProvider("testnet");
    let wallet = new mxw.Wallet(privateKey, networkProvider);
    wallet.isWhitelisted().then((result)=>{
        console.log(result);
    }); 
    // expected result:
    // true or false
